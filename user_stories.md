User Stories for BusMall Start

Marketing Research Team
  1) I want a focus group to be randomly presented with 20 of our products so they can vote on which they prefer 
  2) I want the focus group users to select from three random products at a time to avoid bias by limiting options 
  3) I want to know how many times a product was selected by a user so I can measure general interest
  4) I want to know the percentage of times an image was displayed and selected, to better analyze results across multiple focus group users

Developer
  1) I want an objet constructor so I can easily create an object for each product
  2) I want an array of product objects to count votes, and can be used to display 3 images of products
  3) I want a randomizer to select three products for the focus group user to choose from
  4) I want to set a condition to not duplicate the images selected by the randomizer in the same display of three images, or a duplicate after one display iteration
  5) I want to limit the user to 25 votes and tally those votes while recording the number of times a particular product image is called

Focus Group Participant
  1) I want to easily see some sort of instructions so I can follow them
  2) I want to see multiple product options clearly so I can make a fair interest judgement
  3) I want to see how many times I have voted so I can track how many more votes I have
  4) I want to only be able to interact with what I should, so I don't break anything or get lost on what it is I am to do
